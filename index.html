    <p> You will receive 3 points for every correct set you type in. If there are no sets, press escape and you will receive 1 point. However, if you are wrong, you will lose the value you would have received. Similarly, if you do not act in time, it's as if you were wrong. </p>
    <p> Have fun, and check out the source on
