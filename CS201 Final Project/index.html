    This is a Java applet version of the game
    <a href="https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf">set</a>.
    <br>Type in the letters of the set and press enter to claim a set for three points.
    <br>Press escape if there are no sets to get a point.
    <br>If you don't do anything before the timer runs out the computer will go.
    <br>Watch out though, if you enter a set or press escape and you're wrong you'll lose the points.
